Discovering and Presenting Meaningful Insights
To achieve these goals, a comprehensive data analysis was conducted using Power BI, with the following steps:

Data Collection and Preparation:
Gathered and cleaned data from multiple tables, including patient encounters, organizations, patients, payers, and procedures.
Created measures and calculated columns to derive key metrics such as readmission rates, average length of stay, and average cost per visit.
Visualization and Trend Analysis:
Executive Summary: A high-level dashboard providing an overview of key metrics like total admissions, readmissions, average length of stay, and average cost per visit.
Admissions and Readmissions Analysis: Visualizations showing trends in admissions and readmissions, highlighting significant increases in 2014 and 2021, with 2021 coinciding with the COVID-19 pandemic.
Length of Stay Analysis: Charts and tables displaying the distribution of patient length of stay, identifying that the majority of patients had short stays, indicative of efficient handling of quick visits.
Cost Analysis: Stacked bar graphs and line charts showing the distribution of total claim costs and covered amounts by payers, revealing Medicare's significant contribution.
Procedure Analysis: Tables highlighting the base costs of various procedures, identifying high-cost procedures like electrical cardioversion.
Patient Demographics: Visuals depicting patient demographics, providing insights into the patient population served by the hospital.
Financial Performance: Analysis of net revenue by comparing total claim costs and base encounter costs, visualized through line charts to show trends over time.
Quality and Outcome Measures: Visuals evaluating readmission rates, patient satisfaction scores, and clinical outcomes, helping to monitor and improve patient care quality.
Insights and Implications:
Admissions and Readmissions: Significant rise in 2021 due to COVID-19, indicating a need for robust response plans during health crises.
Cost Analysis: High costs associated with certain procedures and inpatient care, highlighting areas for potential cost savings.
Quality Measures: Identified readmission rates and patient satisfaction scores to guide quality improvement initiatives.
